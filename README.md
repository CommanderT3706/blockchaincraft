# blockchaincraft

A economy system in Minecraft that uses blockchain technologies

## Setup

The mod's code is in `fabric`, and only needs to be installed on the server. It runs on the fabric modloader, and can be started with the `runServer` Gradle task.

The code under `server` is the backend of the blockchain. It is a cargo project and can be started with `cargo run` in the folder.
